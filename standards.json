	"description":"  Commissioned by the ancient dwarven king Thakrond Flintbeard during the great Dwarven Empire, Standard Weights and Measurements of Precious Metals and Stones (usually just called 'Standards') is the most widely distributed book in Thelian by a large margin. Standards is an exhaustive guide to valuating metals and gem stones by weight, size, purity, and so on and so on, and is the basis of currency for thousands of years.\n  Standards is entirely self-referential, relating values in relation to silver, and when accompanied by a balance and small weights set, allows merchants to confidently accept coins and gems as currency. Nearly any merchant had to transcribe their own copy in their apprenticeship, and copies can be widely purchased for 1 GP. Any player character with a mercantile background may have a copy of Standards, a balance, and weights in addition to their normal starting gear."
