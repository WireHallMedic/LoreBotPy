{"time":"One year on Molidius consists of 360 days.  The most common calendar is the dwarven one; it divides the year into four seasons of 90 days (Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter).  A day is referred to as 'the 72nd day of Spring,' or 'Spring 72nd.'  Common measurements of time are the month (30 days), fortnight (20 days) and tenday (10 days), in addition to seasons and years.  The month and the tenday both can be used as an unattached unit of time (a tenday from tomorrow), or as part of the calendar (the fourth tenday of Summer).\n\nMolidius has two moons, Elmore and Folio.  Elmore, the larger of the two, completes a cycle every 39 days, while Folio completes a cycle every 27 days; every 351 days they are full together.  On the first day of winter of every 117 years, both moons are full; thus every 117 years is called an age.  Years are referred to by where they lie within an age.  The current year is the seventy-fourth year of the thirty-third age, written as '74, 33a.' A full date is written as 'Summer 17, 74, 33a' for Summer 17th, or more commonly as 'Summer 17, 42' or 'Su 17 42.'  Though begun several hundred years later, this calendar is based on the crowning of the legendary first king of the dwarves, King Uzdek Grambindrol."}
