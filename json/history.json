,"brk'ka":"\tOnly a handful of the most ancient amongst the elves hold the coming of Brk’ka the Cataclysm in living memory. He descended upon the face of Amaraith like a vengeful god, wielding terrible sorceries and commanding armies of men and giants, running monstrous beasts before them. Sinking Tol-Bardor, the island home of the elves beneath the waves, leveling cities, crushing all who would oppose him. Soon the cries of the faithful could no longer be ignored, and the gods were compelled to face the Cataclysm themselves.\n\n\tAnd one by one, he slew them. The gods of good, of evil, and of other things were slain one after another, the Cataclysm usurping their divine power, fueling him further. Only the most minor and forgotten gods were spared, beneath Brk’ka’s notice. And then, the world a smoking ruin, Brk’ka conscripted the entire race of beastmen into his armies, and departed."
